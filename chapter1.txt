Git guide:

git log                                 -> to get info on all the commits
git add .(for all) and git add <insertFileName> 
git commit -m "<insert msg>"            -> to commit changes

git rm --cached -r .                    -> every single file in the post-commit staging area

git merge '<insertBranchName>'

git push origin main -u

.q! (to close vim)


Git ignore:

create gitignore and inside the file:

add each of the files you want to ignore with their file names on each line
and if to ignore all files of a certain extension do ```.txt```

use # to comment

github.com/gitignore                  -> has template ideas of how to remove files of different projects (like node, react, etc)
